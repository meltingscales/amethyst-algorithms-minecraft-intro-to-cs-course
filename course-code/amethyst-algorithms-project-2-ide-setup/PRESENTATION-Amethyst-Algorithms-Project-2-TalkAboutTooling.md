# IDE choice

We're going to be using IntelliJ IDEA. Both "Community" and "Ultimate" edition will work.

This is not necessary, but recommended. I prefer IntelliJ IDEA, and if you're a student with a `.edu` or similar email, you can get the "Ultimate" edition for free on their website.

# Debugging

# Java

# Gradle

# Neoforged

# sample `onBlockBreak`
