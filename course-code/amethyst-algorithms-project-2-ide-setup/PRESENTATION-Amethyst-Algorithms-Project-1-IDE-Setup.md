# What is this?

Amethyst Algorithms is a course aimed at smart highschoolers or average college students, meant to teach you how to do software programming using Minecraft and NeoForged.

If you're age 15+, like Minecraft, and want to learn programming, you should give this course a try :)

# IDE choice

We're going to be using IntelliJ IDEA. This is not necessary, but recommended. I prefer IntelliJ IDEA, and if you're a student with a `.edu` or similar email, you can get it for free on their website.

# Java

# Gradle
