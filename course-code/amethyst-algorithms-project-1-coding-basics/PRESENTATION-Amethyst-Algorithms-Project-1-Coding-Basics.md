# What is this?

Amethyst Algorithms is a course aimed at smart highschoolers or average college students, meant to teach you how to do software programming using Minecraft and NeoForged.

If you're age 15+, like Minecraft, and want to learn programming, you should give this course a try.

# Tooling setup

You'll need to install a few tools first!

If using Windows, I highly recommend using Chocolatey `choco` to install packages. It is a fantastic package manager similar to `apt` or `yum`.

- [choco](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup/)

If using Linux, this will depend. I recommend Ubuntu for beginners.

1. [Install IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
   - [Windows JetBrains Toolbox](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/jetbrainstoolbox)
   - [Linux/OSX JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Install Java Development Kit 21
    - [Windows Java 21](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/openjdk/21.0.0)
    - [Linux/OSX Java 21](https://askubuntu.com/a/1492589)

# Git setup

I'll assume you've installed Git. You just need to run the below:
1. Open a terminal and `cd` to the place you'd like the repository to live.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/meltingscales/amethyst-algorithms-minecraft-intro-to-cs-course`

# Java setup

Nothing to be done! Just install JDK 21 (not JRE 21).

# IDE setup

Next, we're going to set up your IDE.

(Live demo: Henry shows you how to set it up and import)
