# Amethyst Algorithms: Minecraft Intro to CS Course

![Amethyst Algorithms](amethyst-algorithms.png)

my desire to teach and love of minecraft all rolled into one

in sha' Allah 2025 I get to teach at a university

## course links

TBD

## summary

This course is meant to get you up to speed with many different important computer science topics using the game Minecraft as a substrate.

You'll learn basic Java syntax, how to set up an editor, how to run Java code, and slowly get more advanced until you're creating new items, new mobs, new world-generation, and more advanced concepts like custom GUIs, abstraction, interfaces, profiling, runtime complexity, 3d model editing, and more!

## tools

- a computer with 8GB of RAM
- Java 21
- JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA
- TODO: Pixel art editor for Minecraft art?

## high level topics

### easy

- debugging
- ide setup
- basic syntax
- object oriented programming (and why it can be evil OR useful)

### medium

- data types
- interfaces
- abstraction
- texture mapping
- rendering
- custom GUI

### hard

- a* pathfinding
- profiling
- runtime complexity
- optimization
- 3d models

## course overview

### project 1: IDE Setup

- why are we using a very advanced editor?
- how do we debug?
- what is gradle?
-
- why are we doing IDE setup before language basics?

### project 2: coding basics

TODO add <https://github.com/meltingscales/examples/tree/master/java/>, incorporate it into lessons

- 2.1: [java syntax](https://github.com/meltingscales/examples/blob/master/java/java-basics/src/JavaBasics.java)
- 2.2: data types: str, float, list, array, char[]
- 2.3: variables: local, global
- 2.4: simple statements
- 2.5: 
- advanced statements
- order of evaluation
- classes
- why should we use OOP?
- why is OOP bad sometimes?
- for loops
- while loops

### project 3: let's make our own tree!


- new wood block + texture
- new leaf block + texture
- how do we extend the OakTree class?
- 

### project 4: let's make our own ore, AmethystOre, a crafting recipe, and an AmethystPickaxe pickaxe item

### project 5: aside: how can we learn more about making mods? (discord/StackOverflow/other OSS)
