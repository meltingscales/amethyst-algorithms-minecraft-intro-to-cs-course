my desire to teach and love of minecraft all rolled into one

You'll learn basic Java syntax, how to set up an editor, how to run Java code, and slowly get more advanced until you're creating new items, new mobs, new world-generation, and more advanced concepts like custom GUIs, abstraction, interfaces, profiling, runtime complexity, 3d model editing, and more!
